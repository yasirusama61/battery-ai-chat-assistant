A conversational AI assistant designed to answer technical queries about battery performance, maintenance, and troubleshooting. This project leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to provide insights into battery concepts such as **State of Charge (SOC)**, **State of Health (SOH)**, and **aging trends**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Domain Expertise**: Provides detailed responses to battery-related queries.
- **PDF Crawling and QA Generation**: Automated extraction of battery-related content from research papers to create question-answer datasets.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly chatbot to simulate real-time Q&A.
- **Scalable**: Fine-tune with additional data to adapt to new scenarios.
- **Efficient Deployment**: Designed for seamless integration as a web app or API.

## 📜 How It Works

1. **PDF Crawling and Text Extraction**: Automatically crawls PDFs from sources like ArXiv, downloads them, and extracts meaningful text for processing.
2. **QA Pair Generation**: Converts extracted text into question-answer pairs for fine-tuning.
3. **Model Training**: Fine-tunes an open-source LLM (e.g., GPT-J, Llama) using the generated QA pairs.
4. **Chatbot Development**: Integrates the trained model into a chatbot interface.
5. **Deployment**: Deploys the chatbot as a web app or API for public use.

## 📊 Results

### 1. Word Count of Extracted Texts
We processed the extracted text from crawled PDFs and analyzed the word count distribution. Below is the visualization of word counts across the processed files:

![Word Count Distribution](results/word_count_distribution.png)

**Description**:
- This bar chart represents the total number of words extracted from each text file.
- Highlights variability in the content length across PDFs.

---

### 2. QA Pair Statistics
We generated QA pairs from the extracted text and analyzed the distribution of question and answer lengths.

**Description**:
- This histogram shows the distribution of word counts in generated questions and answers.
- Useful for understanding the complexity and verbosity of the generated QA pairs.
