A conversational AI assistant designed to answer technical queries about battery performance, maintenance, and troubleshooting. This project leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to provide insights into battery concepts such as **State of Charge (SOC)**, **State of Health (SOH)**, and **aging trends**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Domain Expertise**: Provides detailed responses to battery-related queries.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly chatbot to simulate real-time Q&A.
- **Scalable**: Fine-tune with additional data to adapt to new scenarios.
- **Efficient Deployment**: Designed for seamless integration as a web app or API.

## 📜 How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect and preprocess battery-related datasets from sources like Kaggle or research papers.
2. **Model Training**: Fine-tune an open-source LLM (e.g., GPT-J, Llama) using question-answer pairs.
3. **Chatbot Development**: Integrate the trained model into a chatbot interface.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the chatbot as a web app or API for public use.
