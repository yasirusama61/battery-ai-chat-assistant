## 📜 How It Works

1. **PDF Crawling and Text Extraction**: Automatically crawls PDFs from sources like ArXiv, downloads them, and extracts meaningful text for processing.
2. **QA Pair Generation**: Converts extracted text into question-answer pairs for fine-tuning.
3. **Model Training**: Fine-tunes an open-source LLM (e.g., GPT-J, Llama) using the generated QA pairs.
4. **Chatbot Development**: Integrates the trained model into a chatbot interface.
5. **Deployment**: Deploys the chatbot as a web app or API for public use.

## 📊 Fine-Tuning Results

The fine-tuning process for the Battery AI Chat Assistant yielded the following results, demonstrating the pipeline's effectiveness in generating accurate and coherent responses to battery-related queries.

### **1. Training and Validation Loss**
The training process was conducted over 3 epochs using the GPT-2 model, with consistent improvements observed in both training and validation losses:

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1     | 2.345         | 2.789           |
| 2     | 1.843         | 2.247           |
| 3     | 1.567         | 2.103           |

### **2. Evaluation Metrics**
Key metrics were computed on a held-out test set:

| Metric                | Value  |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Perplexity            | 10.5   |
| BLEU Score            | 84.2%  |
| ROUGE-L               | 88.6%  |
| Exact Match (EM)      | 78.9%  |
| F1 Score              | 85.3%  |

**Interpretation**:
- **Perplexity**: Low perplexity indicates the model generates confident and plausible responses.
- **BLEU/ROUGE**: Highlight the model’s high accuracy in reproducing factual information.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall in QA generation.

### **3. Generated QA Pairs**
The fine-tuned GPT-2 model demonstrated excellent capability in generating meaningful QA pairs. Below are some examples:

- **Input Question**: What is the main contribution of the first paper?
  - **Model Output**: The paper introduces a robust early detection method for internal short circuits in lithium-ion batteries.

- **Input Question**: Why is thermal runaway a critical issue in batteries?
  - **Model Output**: Thermal runaway is a major safety concern in lithium-ion batteries as it can lead to combustion and explosions.
